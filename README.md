```

A single-binary ðŸŒ¯ wrapper around `docker compose` with embedded configurations to effortlessly run your local observability stack.

The underlying observability stack is built on [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) products and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). It includes the following services:

* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/)
* [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/)
* [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/)
* [MinIO](https://min.io/)
* [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/)
* [Prometheus](https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/)
* [Pyroscope](https://pyroscope.io/)

## Prerequisites

`run-o11y-run` depends on the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes the `docker compose` command.

## Quick Start

### Install

#### brew

Install [brew](https://brew.sh/) and then run:

```sh
brew install krzko/tap/run-o11y-run
```

#### Download Binary

Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/krzko/run-o11y-run/releases) page.

### Run

* Run `run-o11y-run`
* Configure your service to push telemetry data to one of the following endpoints. This can be done by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable or updating your config file. Make sure to set the traffic to **insecure**:
    * OTLP (grpc): http://localhost:4317
    * OTLP (http): http://localhost:4318
    * Jaeger: http://localhost:14268
    * Zipkin: http://localhost:9411
* Logs are processed via two means:
  * Tailed from `/var/log/*.log` and `./*.log` on your local machine.
  * A Syslog RFC 3164 header format, `syslog` receiver operates on `localhost:8094`
* Profiling data can be pushed to http://localhost:4040
* To exit gracefully, press `CTRL+C`.

## Commands

`run-o11y-run` is a powerful command-line tool that provides seamless management of your local observability stack. It offers three simple commands: `start`, `stop`, and `clean`.

```sh

### `start` Command

The `start` command allows you to launch run-o11y-run containers and start your observability stack effortlessly. You can customise the behaviour using various flags.

One such flag is the `--registry` flag, which enables you to specify a Docker Registry from which to pull the required images. By default, run-o11y-run uses Docker Hub as the registry. Here's an example of using the `--registry flag`:

```sh
run-o11y-run start --registry <registry-url>
```

Replace `<registry-url>` with the URL of your desired Docker Registry.

To further enhance your setup, you can also utilise the `--external-network` flag, which enables integration of your own docker-compose configurations with run-o11y-run. This allows you to combine the services of run-o11y-run with your existing infrastructure seamlessly.

To start run-o11y-run in `detached` mode, use the `--detach` flag. This will start the containers in the background.

The `--yolo` flag can be used with the run-o11y-run command to apply the `:latest` tag to all images in your stack. This flag allows you to conveniently run the latest versions of the images without specifying the specific tags.

  * **NOTE:** However, please note that using the `--yolo` flag may introduce potential risks, as it may lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behaviour if the latest images have breaking changes or dependencies

For more details on using the `--external-network` flag, refer to the [External Network](docs/external-network.md) guide.

### `patch` Command

The `patch` command in run-o11y-run provides a convenient way to modify your own `docker-compose.yaml` file, allowing you to establish a network bridge between the `o11y` stack and your customer stack. This feature is particularly useful when you have started the `o11y` stack with the `--external-network` flag, enabling seamless integration with your existing infrastructure.

See the extended [patch](docs/patch.md) documentation for more detailed information.

### `stop` Command

The `stop` command is used to gracefully stop the run-o11y-run containers. It ensures a clean shutdown of your observability stack. Here's an example of using the `stop` command:

```sh
run-o11y-run stop
```

### `open` Command

The `open` command allows you to conveniently open various services provided by run-o11y-run in your default web browser. This feature saves you time by quickly launching the relevant service pages.:

```sh
run-o11y-run open --service <loki|tempo|prometheus|prometheus-direct|pyroscope-direct>
```

Ensure that run-o11y-run is already running before using the open command.

**Note:** Make sure your default web browser is properly configured on your system for this command to work.

### `clean` Command

The `clean` command is used to stop and remove run-o11y-run containers, files, and networks. It helps you clean up your environment after using run-o11y-run. Here's an example of using the `clean` command:

```sh
run-o11y-run clean
```

### `ports` Command

The `ports` command allows you to list the available ports used by the application. It provides a convenient way to check which ports are used by various services within the observability stack.

Here's an example output of the ports command:

```sh
+-----------+-------------------+
|   PORT    |      SERVICE      |
+-----------+-------------------+
| 3000/tcp  | Grafana           |
| 3100/tcp  | Loki              |
| 4040/tcp  | Pyropscope        |
| 4317/tcp  | OTLP (gRPC)       |
| 4318/tcp  | OTLP (HTTP)       |
| 8094/tcp  | Syslog (RFC3164)  |
| 9090/tcp  | Prometheus Direct |
| 9411/tcp  | Zipkin            |
| 14268/tcp | Jaeger            |
+-----------+-------------------+
```
